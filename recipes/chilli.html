    <li><strong>Beef</strong>:The recipe starts with a pound of ground beef. You can use ground turkey if you prefer. </li>
    <li><strong>Onion</strong>:Cooking a chopped onion with the ground meat adds tons of flavor.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Canned Goods</strong>:You'll need a can of tomato sauce, a can of stewed tomatoes, and a can of kidney beans.</li>
    <li><strong>Spices</strong>:This homemade chili is spiced with chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper. </li>

    <h1> Directions </h1>

    homemade chili:</p>
    
    <h3>How To Make Cowboy Chili</h3>
    <p>Though the process for making cowboy chili takes a while, the steps are pretty easy.</p>

    <ol><strong> 1.Sauté the beef.</strong> Stir the beef, garlic, and onion in large saucepan until the meat is browned. Then, drain any excess
    liquid.</ol>
    <ol><strong> 2. Add the tomatoes and spices.</strong> Stir them in, then cover the pot.</ol>
    <ol><strong> 3. Simmer.</strong> Let the chili simmer over low heat for about an hour, stirring only occasionally.</ol>
    <ol><strong> 4. Add the beans and salt</strong> Then, cook for another 15 minutes.</ol>
    <ol><strong> 5. Serve.</strong> Spoon the chili into individual serving bowls and top with your favorite add-ons. Then sit back and enjoy your cozy bowl
    of comfort.</ol>

    <h3>What Gives Chili the Best Flavor?</h3>

    <p>Fun fact: Did you know that traditional chili didn’t actually contain beans?</p>
    <p>However, since beef was valuable and limited back in the day, people would normally serve chili with a side of beans to
    bulk it up.
