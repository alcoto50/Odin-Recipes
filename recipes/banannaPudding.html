    <h1> Momma's "Bustling" Bananna Puddding </h1>

    <P> This is a recipe from my grandmothers ridiculesly delicious Desert index recipe box! When I was a kid I would sit and wait for the spoon on this one!</P>
    <p> Below are a list of ingredients needed to make this <em>magical</em> dessert!</p>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. cornstarch</li>
    <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
    <li>2 1/4 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>2 1/4 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
    <li>3 1/3 cups vanilla wafers</li>
    <li>4 ripe bananas, cut into 1/2-in. slices</li>
    <li>3 Tbsp. sugar</li>

    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <p><strong> Step 1</strong> </p>
    <p>Preheat oven to 375°F. Whisk together first 3 ingredients in a small bowl. Whisk together sugar mixture, milk, and 4 egg
    yolks in a medium-size heavy saucepan until well blended. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, 6 to 8 minutes or
    until thickened. Remove from heat; stir in butter and vanilla.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>Layer half of vanilla wafers in an 8-inch square baking dish. Top with half of banana slices and half of pudding. Repeat
    procedure with remaining wafers, banana slices, and pudding.
    </p>
    <p><Strong>Step 3</Strong></p>
    <p>Beat egg whites at high speed with an electric mixer until foamy. Gradually add 3 Tbsp. sugar, beating until sugar
    dissolves and stiff peaks form, about 5 minutes. Spread meringue over pudding, sealing to edge of dish.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
    <p>Bake at 375°F for 7 to 9 minutes or until golden. Let cool 30 minutes, and serve warm; or chill an additional hour, and
    serve cold.</p>

    <h3> Tips </h3>
    <p>This pudding gets thicker as it cools. When it's warm, it may be a bit looser.</p>
